This is a small project I did back in highschool so that I could better understand Object oriented programming with classes and inheritance in C++. The project giles can be found in my [Github](https://github.com/TKKetron/Text-Based-RPG/tree/master).

I had a simple UI that allowed the game to be operated via the keyboard. It updated dynamically by catching all inputs from the user using the _getch function from the Conio library. This allowed it to feel more like a game instead of typing into a command line interface.

I had randomly generated enemies and loot that dropped from the enemies as shown below. There was even a chance you could run into bosses and fight them.

during and between fights you had an inventory you could access using dynamically assigned arrays. The inventory system is shown below. The end goal of this game was simple and to progress as far into the dungeon as possible, but mainly the purpose was to challenge myself in creating something I enjoy.
