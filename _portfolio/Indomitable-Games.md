A "company" i have made for developing games in my free time. Currently this is a massive work in progress and hasn't made any gems yet but in my free time I have begun development of my first real game. we are currently using Unity because I have had some experience with it in the past.

***Planetary Domination***
This is the first game I am currently working on with a friend. The idea of the game is a optimization based base builder, similar to games like Factorio. It is still in VERY early stages of development and all we have is player movement and a very simple menuing system.

Above shows our current testing state, We have just a character able to walk around on a randomly generated world and collision on objects like the house in the top left. Currently we are working on advanced world generation and then moving onto item interactions.
