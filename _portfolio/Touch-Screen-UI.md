A touchscreen UI made to operate a cold brew coffee machine. The UI system was run in a C# winform on a raspberry pi. I was able to install windows the the Raspberry pi using the WOR project and chose to install Tiny11 a lightweight version of windows 11 so that it would run smoother on the PI.

Unfortunately I cannot provide the code for this project due to it being from my word at advanced automation, but I do have a demo of it working

The raspberry pi running this also controlled all of the values and heaters to brew coffee. This was a completely automated system that would take the user input and brew kegs of coffee developed by advanced automation.
