![Illustration of snake my favorite project I have done](/images/snake_homepage.png){: .align-right width="300"}


I am a senior at the University of Louisville studying Computer Science Engineering. I have lots of personal projects of things I have done in the past you can check out [here](https://tkketron.github.io/portfolio/).

I enjoy making things in my free time, be it physical projects like rockets at the River City Rocket Team, or circuit boards for various projects. Most of all I enjoy making things on a computer in my free time. I have various different projects including some games and algorithm design.
